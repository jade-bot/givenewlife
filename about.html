                <p>
                    <strong>We believe that women can effect positive change on the mothering culture of their own countries.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women around the world often live their lives suppressed, without a voice for their own family and falling prey to the cycles of poverty, disease and death.  New Life exists to empower them with the information, best practices, nutritional aid, educational support, and health care access to help them break out of their current conditions and live a New Life.  We are focusing on three slum areas in the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are starting with a Meal Center to offer a nutritious meal once a day to a group of families, who eventually will be the core leaders and promoters at New Life.  We are researching the best ways to feed these vulnerable populations with they nutrients they need to become or stay healthy.  Access to clean water is a first-line effort as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conjunction with the Meal Center, breastfeeding education and support is already beginning.  We are training mothers who have successfully breastfed to become peer counselors to other mothers to help with common issues, dispel myths and encourage longer duration of breastfeeding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Phase 2 of New Life's operations, we will be addressing safer birthing options, more work with sanitary living conditions and starting a supplemental food and nutritional pantry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase 3 includes plans for a donor breast milk bank for vulnerable infants, beginning vocational training for adults and supporting education for children.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Our Operative Principles
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Once a family comes into the program, we serve them until they no longer need assistance. We work to help them thrive in any areas of need.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that there will be enough.  We have set our target population parameters, but when we come across people outside of our target population who need assistance, we are glad to help. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are conduits.  We expect that the information disseminated and help given will trickle to more and more of the community as people share their new knowledge and help others.  By helping the people who come our way, we are giving them the tools to help others they encounter.  In this way, we will create societal change as empowerment and best practices become the norm.
